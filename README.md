# Chibicc : A Toy C Compiler by Cpp
This repository will serve as a record of my study of chibicc. Based on this foundation, I intend to implement a full rewrite of the project using C++.

## How to build Chibicc
After clone this repository, you could build Chibicc by:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
../test.sh   ./Chibicc
```
